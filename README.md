# World_Weather_Analysis
The [Weather_Database folder] (https://github.com/SohaT7/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Weather_Database) collects the weather database for multiple cities around the globe.
The [Vacation_Search folder] (https://github.com/SohaT7/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Vacation_Search) asks the customer for an input ont heir weather preferences and lays out only those cities which pertain to those weather preferences, and thus liked by the customer to travel to.
The [Vacation_Itinerary folder] (https://github.com/SohaT7/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Vacation_Itinerary) builds a travel itinerary between the four cities from among the cities the customer would like to travel to (i.e. those that pertain to the customer's weather preferences).
